### Hello, my name is Aleksa üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! üéâ

I'm a software engineer with 4+ years of diverse, professional experience. I'm always striving to make things faster, simpler, and more user and developer-friendly.

Frontend development is the most interesting part of my career. I always keen to write well-designed, performant, fully tested code that works across multiple browsers as well responsive on all latest devices. For the past few years, I have been concentrated on React and Redux development but I'm always open to learning new technologies especially if they are related to JavaScript.

Some of recent projects I've been working on:

- [**Ozavala**](https://www.ozavala.co.rs) - A web application for Youth Cooperative. The application is built with NextJS, Firebase, and Chakra UI. It is hosted on Vercel.

I'm currently working as a **Software Engineer** at [Vega IT](https://www.vegait.rs). üë®‚Äçüíª

If you have any questions or if you want to connect with me, feel free to drop me an email at aleksa.mitic5859@gmail.com.
